# Personal Portfolio Page

This repository contains a simple, responsive personal portfolio built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Deployment with Vercel

This project is designed for seamless deployment on Vercel.

1.  **Link Repository:** Connect this GitHub repository to your Vercel account via the Vercel dashboard.
2.  **Configure Build Settings:** Since this is a pure static HTML/CSS/JS project, Vercel will automatically detect it as a standard static site (Framework preset: None or Static).
3.  **Deploy:** Vercel will handle the build process (which requires no compilation for static assets) and deploy the `index.html` file directly to the root of the deployment.
